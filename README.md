# Preboot 2 (SCSS conversion)

Preboot is a collection of LESS mixins and variables for quickly writing CSS. As the precursor to [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), it serves as a lightweight and interface agnostic approach to jumpstarting your next web project. Use it how you see fit.

This project is a conversion of the LESS version to SASS (in SCSS syntax).

## Getting started

Preboot.scss requires [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). Head over to their documentation and familiarize yourself with the project. Once you're up and running, including and using Preboot is a breeze.

1. Create a new SCSS file (e.g., application.scss)
2. Include Preboot via `@import "preboot;"`
3. Start writing your own SCSS-flavored CSS

We highly recommend using Preboot in conjunction with [Normalize](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css), a powerful tool for more consistent rendering of web components across various browsers and devices.

## Brief history

Preboot was originally released in March 2011 under the name Bootstrap.less. Sensing the need for a larger and more comprehensive framework, I copped the name and created Bootstrap based on the original variables and mixins work here. To avoid obivous naming issues, I renamed this Preboot and essentially didn't touch the project for two years.

Fast forward two years and I'm backporting many of Bootstrap's variables and mixins back into Preboot as v2.
